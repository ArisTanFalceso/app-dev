✨: **letters to juliet (2010)** ✨:
⭐:  > *Each year, the town of Verona, Italy — home of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet — receives thousands of letters of heartache and unrequited love addressed to the play's star-crossed heroine. The tradition of sending letters to Juliet very likely goes back centuries.* 📑:
✨ *i just find it so romantic how people would write to juliet about their life, successful love and even the failed ones. it is almost as if talking to juliet herself getting replies and advise from penpals.*
